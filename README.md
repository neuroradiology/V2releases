# Visual2
A friendly ARM assembler and simulator for educational use.


This is an open access repo holding releases of [Visual2](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Visual2). This will go open source within a few months and this site will have releases and documentation before that.

Anyone wanting to see the closed code and/or contribute contact me and I can add.

Binaries (currently for linux and windows only) will be posted here under releases. Please give user feedback on binaries as issues on this repository.
