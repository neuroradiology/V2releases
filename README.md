# Visual2
A friendly ARM assembler and simulator for educational use


This is a placeholder for the public version of [Visual2](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Visual2). This will not go open source till next year but parts of the project will be open earlier and put here.

Anyone wanting to see the closed code and/or contribute contact me and I can add.

Binaries (currently for linux and windows only) will be posted here under releases. Please give user feedback on binaries as issues on this repository.
