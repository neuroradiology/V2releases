# VisUAL2

A friendly ARM assembler and simulator for educational use.

Visual2 will run on Windows, OS-X and linux and is distributed as binaries

## Getting Started

1. Download the [latest Visual2 binary release](https://github.com/tomcl/V2releases/releases) for your platform

### Windows

* Unzip the download anywhere on your system
* To run the program double-click the executable `VisUAL2.exe` which can be found in the top-level unzipped directory.
* No installation is required

### OS-X

* Open the DMG file
* Drag the Visual2 directory into the app files directory as normal to install


### Linux

* Untested (using standard electron-packager output)
* Unzip the download
* Run Visual2
* In case of problems check the documentation on running electron applications on your distro. Contact [me](t.clarke@ic.ac.uk) if you'd like access to the source repo [Visual2](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Visual2) and compile Visual2 from source, which may be easier to run under linux.


## Command Line Switches

```
visual2.exe [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
```

* Ctrl-Shift-I (in debug mode) open dev tools to show test results etc

## Visual2 Documentation
